# Smol CLI

## Problem

> Coding with AI is powerful — but too heavy for the terminal.

Developers constantly switch between their **editor**, **browser**, and **terminal** just to get small code changes done.
Most AI tools are:
- Slow and web-only
- Locked to one provider
- Cluttered with UI noise

Simple edits like “add CSS to this file” or “refactor function” break your workflow.

## Solution

> A lightweight, local-first AI assistant that *feels native* to the command line.

**Smol CLI** brings AI code editing directly to your terminal:

- Built entirely in **Rust** using **Ratatui** (TUI) + **Crossterm** (input)
- Connects to **OpenRouter** for access to GPT-4, DeepSeek, Qwen, and more
- Applies code edits safely with previews, diffs, and backups
- Curates models by capability, context size, and pricing (auto-fetched)
- All in a cute, fast, minimal terminal UI — featuring your cat assistant `(=^･ω･^=)`
